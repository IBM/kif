Release v0.7.2
==============

- `codec`: Added a new encoder: Dot.  This is useful for displaying graphs.

Release v0.7.1
==============

- `docs`: Updated quickstart and API reference.  Removed legacy stuff.

Release v0.7.0
==============

- All SPARQL-based stores suffered a major refactoring.  Now they all derive
  from a base SPARQL store which supports multiple back-ends (currently,
  Httpx and RDFLib).  Also, the SPARQL-based stores now use the new SPARQL
  compilation pipeline, which is completely parameterized by SPARQL
  mappings.  The old SPARQL compilation code was removed.

- The code of other stores, including the common code in `abc`, was
  simplified.

- The Wikidata mappings now generate a single query to resolve
  `Store.filter_annotated()`.

- Legacy descriptor classes were removed, as these were superseded by
  pseudo-properties.

Release v0.6.3
==============

- Bug-fix release.  Fixed bug (regression) that was causing
  `Store.extra_references` to not be honored.

Release v0.6.2
==============

- `SPARQL_Store`: Fixed the query generated by `get_annotations()`.  It no
  longer assumes that properties occurring in qualifier and reference snaks
  adopt the Wikidata RDF schema.

Release v0.4
============

- `Property.range`: Added a new `range` field (datatype) to `Property`.
  This information is now being retrieved automatically by most stores.

- `Property.some_value()` and `Propeprty.no_value()`: Added new, simpler
  APIs to construct `SomeValueSnak`'s and `NoValueSnaks`'s.

- `Filter`: Renamed the `FilterPattern` object to `Filter` to distinguish it
  from patterns.

- More expressive fingerprints: Redesigned the structure of fingerprints.
  We now distinguish between value and snak fingerprints and allow these to
  be composed using and's (`&`) and or's (`|`).

- Subject, property, and value masks in `filter()`: Added full support for
   entity masks to `Filter`.

- The `SPARQL_Store` is finally using the compiler infrastructure and
  template instantiation to generate the SPARQL query of `filter()` and
  parse the results.

- `vocabulary.wd.downloader`: Added a new entity description downloader
  module.  Also, updated the format of the TSV files.
