Release v0.6.3
==============

- Bug-fix release.  Fixed bug (regression) that was causing
  `Store.extra_references` to not be honored.

Release v0.6.2
==============

- `SPARQL_Store`: Fixed the query generated by `get_annotations()`.  It no
  longer assumes that properties occurring in qualifier and reference snaks
  adopt the Wikidata RDF schema.

Release v0.4
============

- `Property.range`: Added a new `range` field (datatype) to `Property`.
  This information is now being retrieved automatically by most stores.

- `Property.some_value()` and `Propeprty.no_value()`: Added new, simpler
  APIs to construct `SomeValueSnak`'s and `NoValueSnaks`'s.

- `Filter`: Renamed the `FilterPattern` object to `Filter` to distinguish it
  from patterns.

- More expressive fingerprints: Redesigned the structure of fingerprints.
  We now distinguish between value and snak fingerprints and allow these to
  be composed using and's (`&`) and or's (`|`).

- Subject, property, and value masks in `filter()`: Added full support for
   entity masks to `Filter`.

- The `SPARQL_Store` is finally using the compiler infrastructure and
  template instantiation to generate the SPARQL query of `filter()` and
  parse the results.

- `vocabulary.wd.downloader`: Added a new entity description downloader
  module.  Also, updated the format of the TSV files.
